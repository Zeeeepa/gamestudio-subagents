# - Reference market analysis results
# - Configure agent team based on mode
# - Set up communication protocols
# - Establish workflow phases
# - Create handoff procedures
```

### ✅ Step 4: Data Scientist Integration

```bash
# Test data science setup
claude "Read agents/data_scientist.md and set up analytics framework for the project."

# Expected Agent Behavior:
# - Design telemetry collection
# - Plan A/B testing framework
# - Set up player segmentation
# - Create performance monitoring
# - Establish KPI tracking
```

### ✅ Step 5: Producer Agent Coordination

### ✅ Agent Communication Flow

```
1. User runs init_project.py
   ↓
2. Script collects project details (including competitors & USP)
   ↓
3. Project structure created with config
   ↓
4. User activates Market Analyst
   ↓
5. Market analysis provides Go/No-Go
   ↓
6. If Go: Master Orchestrator activates
   ↓
7. Orchestrator configures agent team
   ↓
8. Producer Agent manages execution
   ↓
9. Data Scientist tracks throughout
   ↓
10. All agents coordinate for delivery
```
