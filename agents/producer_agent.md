```

### Step 2: Agent Team Configuration

Based on the project requirements, configure the optimal agent team:

```python
def configure_agent_team(project_config):
    agents = ["producer_agent"]  # Always include producer
    
    # Core design team
    if project_config["scope"] != "Minimal":
        agents.extend(["sr_game_designer", "mid_game_designer"])
    else:
        agents.append("sr_game_designer")
    
    # Engineering team
    if project_config["mode"] == "development":
        agents.append("mechanics_developer")
        
        if project_config["audience"] in ["Casual", "Kids"]:
            agents.append("game_feel_developer")  # Priority on polish
    
    # Art team
    if project_config["visual_style"] != "Abstract":
        agents.append("sr_game_artist")
        
        if project_config["platform"] in ["PC", "Console"]:
            agents.append("technical_artist")
    
    # Specialized agents
    if project_config["platform"] == "Mobile":
        agents.append("ui_ux_agent")  # Critical for mobile
    
    # QA is essential for development
    if project_config["mode"] in ["development", "prototype"]:
        agents.append("qa_agent")
    
    return agents
```

### Step 3: Create Project Configuration

Generate `project-config.json`:

```json

# Create project structure
create_project() {
  PROJECT_NAME=$1
  mkdir -p "projects/$PROJECT_NAME"/{documentation,source,resources,qa}
  mkdir -p "projects/$PROJECT_NAME"/documentation/{design,art,technical,production}
  echo "Project $PROJECT_NAME initialized"
}
```

### Status Report Generator
```python
def generate_status_report(project_name, week_number):
    report = {
        "project": project_name,
        "week": week_number,
        "phase": get_current_phase(),
        "health": calculate_health_score(),

```

## Decision Authority

### Producer Can Decide
- Timeline adjustments (minor)
- Resource reallocation
- Task prioritization
- Quality standards
- Integration schedule

### Requires Orchestrator Approval
- Scope changes (major)
- Timeline extensions (major)
- Additional resources
- Project cancellation
- Engine change

### Requires Stakeholder Input
- Monetization changes
- Platform additions
- Feature cuts (core)
- Release date changes
- Budget increases

## Best Practices

1. **Start with Why** - Understand project goals before planning
2. **Plan for Problems** - Build buffer time into schedules
3. **Communicate Early** - Flag issues before they become blockers
4. **Document Decisions** - Maintain clear audit trail
5. **Iterate Quickly** - Fail fast and adjust
6. **Protect the Team** - Shield agents from scope creep
7. **Celebrate Wins** - Acknowledge completed milestones
8. **Learn from Failures** - Conduct retrospectives
9. **Stay Flexible** - Adapt to changing requirements
10. **Focus on Shipping** - Done is better than perfect
